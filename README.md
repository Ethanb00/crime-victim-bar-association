# crime-victim-bar-association

Hi and welcome to this thing.

This is my ongoing to project to build a site with case management and many-to-one relationships for the National Crime Victim Bar Assoication. It was built/is being built with great haste and by just me. As these things go, there have been changing requirements, no product or project manager, etc. So there are things here that are just plain bad. 

I humbly request that if you find anything that needs patching you let me know with an issue. 

Many thanks.
